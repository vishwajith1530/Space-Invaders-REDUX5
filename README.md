# Project: "Space Invaders, REDUX"
# Creation Date: 1/24/2022
# Description:
 This project began after I watched a tutorial video on YouTube by "Tech with Tim", where he walked through coding the game "Space Invaders".  I followed
 his tutorial and built the base game with my own flair.  I have since added custom sound effects, artwork and features along with refactoring much of the code to my own
 coding standards and understanding.  This is a work in progress, and I hope by the end of development to have a very solid project that I can be proud of.
 Features coming in the future include:
  - Boss fights
  - Multiplayer
  - Bonus stages
  - New enemy types
  - Ship model selection



  Dependencies

    - Python 3.9.7
    - Pygame 2.0.2
